Project Notes
I started this project so I could put to use all the things I have been learning lately with Python
for example Git, MVC architecture, GUI with wxPython, Connecting my app to the web.
I am going to be using Git for version control. I am also thinking of using a Database. Have a Database of User Data.
Client Server architecture.
I am thinking of doing a ranking based on speed of answering questions.
Also do testing.
